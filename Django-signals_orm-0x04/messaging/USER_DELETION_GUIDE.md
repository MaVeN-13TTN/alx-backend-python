# User Account Deletion with Signals - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation provides comprehensive user account deletion functionality with automatic cleanup of all related data using Django signals. The system ensures data integrity and provides multiple deletion options with proper authentication and confirmation.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **User Deletion Views** (`messaging/views.py`)

**API Endpoints:**

- `DELETE /api/messaging/user/delete/` - Simple user deletion
- `POST /api/messaging/user/delete-with-confirmation/` - Deletion with password confirmation
- `GET /api/messaging/user/data-summary/` - Get user's data summary before deletion

**Features:**

- Authentication required
- Transaction safety
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging
- Data summary for transparency

#### 2. **Post-Delete Signals** (`messaging/signals.py`)

**Signal Handlers:**

- `cleanup_user_messages` - Removes sent/received messages
- `cleanup_user_notifications` - Removes user notifications
- `cleanup_user_message_histories` - Removes edit histories
- `log_user_deletion_summary` - Comprehensive deletion logging
- `cleanup_message_related_data` - Message deletion cleanup

#### 3. **Database CASCADE Relationships**

**Automatic Cleanup via Foreign Keys:**

- Messages: `CASCADE` on sender/receiver deletion
- Notifications: `CASCADE` on user/message deletion
- MessageHistory: `CASCADE` on message/editor deletion

### Deletion Process Flow

## Signal Implementation Details

### User Cleanup Signals

#### 1. Message Cleanup

```python
@receiver(post_delete, sender=User)
def cleanup_user_messages(sender, instance, **kwargs):
```

- Removes all messages sent by the user
- Removes all messages received by the user
- Logs deletion counts
- Handles CASCADE relationships

#### 2. Notification Cleanup

```python
@receiver(post_delete, sender=User)
def cleanup_user_notifications(sender, instance, **kwargs):
```

- Removes all notifications for the user
- Logs deletion counts
- Provides extension points for final notifications

#### 3. Message History Cleanup

```python
@receiver(post_delete, sender=User)
def cleanup_user_message_histories(sender, instance, **kwargs):
```

- Removes histories edited by the user
- Accounts for related message histories via CASCADE
- Provides archival extension points

#### 4. Deletion Summary Logging

```python
@receiver(post_delete, sender=User)
def log_user_deletion_summary(sender, instance, **kwargs):
```

- Comprehensive audit logging
- User information preservation
- Deletion confirmation logging
- External logging service integration points

### Message Cleanup Signal

#### Message-Related Data Cleanup

```python
@receiver(post_delete, sender=Message)
def cleanup_message_related_data(sender, instance, **kwargs):
```

- Logs message deletion details
- Handles notification and history cleanup
- Provides extension points for archival

## Database Schema Considerations

### Foreign Key Relationships

```python
# Message model
sender = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="messaging_sent_messages")
receiver = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="messaging_received_messages")

# Notification model
user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="messaging_notifications")
message = models.ForeignKey(Message, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="messaging_notifications")

# MessageHistory model
message = models.ForeignKey(Message, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="histories")
edited_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="edited_histories")
```

### Cascade Behavior

1. **User Deleted** → All sent/received messages deleted → Related notifications/histories deleted
2. **Message Deleted** → Related notifications deleted → Related histories deleted
3. **Editor User Deleted** → Edit histories deleted (but message remains if editor ≠ sender/receiver)

## Testing Coverage

### Test Categories

#### 1. **UserDeletionTests** (8 tests)

- Sent message cleanup
- Received message cleanup
- Notification cleanup
- Message history cleanup
- Multiple user deletion scenarios
- Signal execution verification
- CASCADE relationship integrity
- Partial data cleanup scenarios

#### 2. **UserDeletionAPITests** (3 placeholder tests)

- Data summary endpoint
- Authentication requirements
- Password confirmation flow

### Test Scenarios

```python
# Example test structure
def test_user_deletion_cleans_up_sent_messages(self):
    # Create messages from user1 to user2 and user3
    # Create message from user2 to user1
    # Delete user1
    # Verify only non-user1 messages remain

def test_cascading_deletion_integrity(self):
    # Create interconnected data (messages, notifications, histories)
    # Delete user
    # Verify complete cleanup with no orphaned records
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT token authentication required
- User can only delete their own account
- Password confirmation adds security layer
- Transaction atomicity prevents partial deletions

### Data Privacy

- Complete data removal (GDPR compliance ready)
- No data remnants after deletion
- Audit trail for deletion events
- Secure password verification

### Rate Limiting Considerations

- Consider implementing rate limiting for deletion endpoints
- Prevent abuse of data summary endpoint
- Monitor deletion patterns for security

## Performance Considerations

### Database Operations

- Transaction wrapping ensures atomicity
- CASCADE relationships minimize manual queries
- Bulk operations where possible
- Indexing on foreign key relationships

### Signal Optimization

- Minimal processing in signal handlers
- Error handling prevents signal failures
- Logging for monitoring and debugging
- Extension points for async processing

### Monitoring & Logging

- Comprehensive deletion logging
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance metrics collection
- Audit trail maintenance

## Extension Points

### Custom Business Logic

```python
# In signal handlers
def cleanup_user_messages(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    # Existing cleanup code...

    # Extension points:
    # - Archive important messages before deletion
    # - Send notifications to conversation participants
    # - Update analytics and metrics
    # - Trigger external system cleanups
```

### Integration Options

- **Email Notifications**: Send confirmation emails
- **Analytics**: Track deletion patterns and reasons
- **Backup Systems**: Archive data before deletion
- **External APIs**: Notify third-party services
- **Audit Systems**: Comprehensive compliance logging

### Customization Examples

```python
# Custom deletion confirmation
@receiver(post_delete, sender=User)
def send_deletion_confirmation_email(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    # Send email confirmation to user's email
    pass

# Analytics tracking
@receiver(post_delete, sender=User)
def track_user_deletion_analytics(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    # Send deletion metrics to analytics service
    pass

# Backup integration
@receiver(pre_delete, sender=User)
def backup_user_data(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    # Archive user data to backup system
    pass
```

## Production Deployment

### Environment Variables

```env
# Add to settings
DELETE_USER_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED=true
DELETE_USER_BACKUP_ENABLED=true
DELETE_USER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=true
```

### Monitoring Setup

- Log aggregation for deletion events
- Alerting for bulk deletion patterns
- Performance monitoring for deletion operations
- Database cleanup job monitoring

### Backup Strategy

- Regular database backups before implementing
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Archived data retention policies
- Compliance with data retention regulations

This implementation provides a robust, secure, and scalable user deletion system with comprehensive cleanup capabilities and extensive monitoring and extension options.
