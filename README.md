# Python Generators Project

## About the Project

This project introduces advanced usage of Python generators to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations. The tasks focus on leveraging Python's `yield` keyword to implement generators that provide iterative access to data, promoting optimal resource utilization, and improving performance in data-driven applications.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- **Master Python Generators**: Learn to create and utilize generators for iterative data processing, enabling memory-efficient operations.
- **Handle Large Datasets**: Implement batch processing and lazy loading to work with extensive datasets without overloading memory.
- **Simulate Real-world Scenarios**: Develop solutions to simulate live data updates and apply them to streaming contexts.
- **Optimize Performance**: Use generators to calculate aggregate functions like averages on large datasets, minimizing memory consumption.
- **Apply SQL Knowledge**: Use SQL queries to fetch data dynamically, integrating Python with databases for robust data management.

## Requirements

- Proficiency in Python 3.x.
- Understanding of `yield` and Python's generator functions.
- Familiarity with SQL and database operations (MySQL and SQLite).
- Basic knowledge of database schema design and data seeding.
- Ability to use Git and GitHub for version control and submission.

## Project Structure

- `python-generators-0x00/`: Directory containing the first task implementation
  - `seed.py`: Main script for database setup and data seeding
  - `user_data.csv`: Sample data for database population
  - `.env`: Configuration file for database connection parameters (not tracked in git)
  - `env.example`: Template for the .env file showing required environment variables
  - `.gitignore`: Specifies files that should not be tracked by git
  - `README.md`: Documentation for the specific task

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
